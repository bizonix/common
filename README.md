
Common Libraries
----------------

These are some classes that I've accumulated over the years for use in personal web projects.
I release them here under GPLv3 in the hope that someone else will find them useful,
but I make absolutely no guarantee that these classes will fit your style of web development.

### Getting Started

Include the following line at the top of your script:

    include 'common/autoload.php';

### Class Reference

- [AJAX](https://github.com/kijin/common/blob/master/doc/ajax.md)

More documentation will be added in the future.
